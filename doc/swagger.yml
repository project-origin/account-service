      summary: Get a list of GGOs
      description: >
        Returns an array of GGO objects which belongs to the account.
        The database contains a historical record of prioir received, sent, and
        retired GGOs, so this endpoint will return GGOs that are no longer
        available, unless filtered out.
        
        ## Offset and limit (paging)
        
        The client must provide an "offset" and a "limit" of how many objects to
        return in each request. The response JSON contains the total amount
        of results (independent of the provided offset and limit), and can
        be used to calculate total number of requests required to get all GGOs.
        Its adviced to keep the provided "limit" reasonable low, as JSON encoding-
        and decoding can be rather memory consuming.
        
        ## Filtering
        
        The "filters" object in the request body allows to narrow down results.
        All filters are optional, but can be mixed to perform complex searches.
        Some filters are an array of values, which filters out any GGOs not having
        any of the provided values (analogous to an SQL "IN" statement).
        
        ### Filtering on GGO begin
        
        "begin" is the time at which the energy production began. It usually have an
        end time which is one hour later, but only the begin is filtered upon.
        It is possible to filters GGOs on either one specific begin, or a
        range/period defined by a from- and to datetime.
        These two options should be considered mutually exclusive.
        
        ### Filtering on category
        
        "category" is the current state of a GGO. A GGO can be in multiple categories
        at a time depending on it's lifecycle. For instance, a GGO can be "issued"
        and "stored" at the same time, but can not be "retired" and "stored"
        at the same time. Possible categories are:
        
        - issued
        
        - stored
        
        - retired
        
        - expired

  /ggo-summary:
    post:
      summary: Get a summary of GGOs
      description: >
        Returns a summary of the account's GGOs, or a subset hereof. Useful for plotting or visualizing data.
        
        ## Filtering
        
        GGOs are filtered in the same way as with the /ggo endpoint (above).
        
        ## Time resolution
        
        Data is returned in the data/time resolution specified in the request. The total amount of energy (Wh) is aggregated/summarized for each period. Available resolutions are:
        
        - all
        
        - year
        
        - month
        
        - day
        
        - hour
        
        ## Labels
        
        The response contans an array of labels in order. Each label is a string representing a period of time according to the requested time resolution. There may be gaps in the array, depending on the source data, unless the "fill" parameter in the request is set to true.
        
        ## Grouping
        
        Data can be grouped by multiple different keys, much like an SQL "GROUP BY" statement.
        The returned data is split into one or more groups. Each group has an array of values, which is the aggregated energy for a period of time. The values are in same order as the returned labels. Values may be null.

      summary: Transfer and/or retire a GGO
      description: >
        Transfers or retires a single GGO to one or more accounts and/or MeteringPoints. The operation splits the source GGO up into multiple new GGOs if required to before transferring and retiring takes place. The sum of these can not exceed the source GGO's amount, but can, however deceed it. Any remaining amount is transferred back to the owner of the source GGO.
        
        ## Transfers
        
        Each transfer request contains an amount in Wh, a reference string for future enquiry, and a subject (sub), which is the recipient user's account number.
        
        ## Retires
        
        Each retire request contains an amount in Wh, and a GSRN number to retire the specified amount to.
        
        ## Concurrency
        
        The requested transfers and retires are counted as complete upon a successful response from this endpoint. This means that subsequent requests to other endpoints will count the requested amount transferred or retired immediately. However, due to the asynchronous nature of the blockchain ledger, this operation may be rolled back later in case of an error on the ledger, and will result in the source GGO being stored and available to the source' account again.

        In addition to the filters available for /ggo-summary, an additional filter "reference" is available to narrow down GGOs transferred with specific reference strings. These are the string references provided when composing a transfer using the /compose endpoint.
